__Tokyo JS__ is a group for anyone interested in JavaScript, its good and bad parts. Let's gather to share, explore and learn about everything-JavaScript.


### Code Party

A code party is a special type of workshop where devs are given a list of topics (a new framework / library, project idea, etc.) and they have 3 to 4 hours to code a simple example and 5 minutes to present their work at the end of the session. Projects are supposed to go into their owner's own GitHub account, or in the case of a team you can (1) create a free organization account at `GitHub/<Name of Your Account>` or (2) directly in `TokyoJS/<Team Name>`. Each entry will be featured in `TokyoJS/CodeParty` list for that week or month.

The goal of a Code Party is to promote trying out new technologies surrounded by peers and allow creating more meaningful connections with other members in the community.

## The NPM Package

### Install

Just for fun, you can try installing the TokyoJS [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package (but make sure you have already installed [node](https://nodejs.org) in your system).

```sh
npm install tokyojs
require("tokyojs").hi("your name")
```

### Tests

The demo project uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io) to get some [ES6](http://git.io/es6features) sugar out of the box. From your terminal run `npm test` or `npm run me` to test gears. Everything should build, transpile and test alright.

### Feedback

If you have any questions, concerns, feedback and / or suggestions, please feel free to open and issue [here](https://github.com/tokyojs/QA/issues).
